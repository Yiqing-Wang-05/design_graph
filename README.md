# 🌍 design_graph: Interactive Climate Visualization Redesign

This repository contains the final implementation of **"Feeling the Heat: An Interactive Redesign of Global Climate Visualization"**, a course project for **INFOSCI 301 – Data Visualization and Information Aesthetics** at Duke Kunshan University.

## 📌 Project Overview

This project redesigns a static choropleth map of projected Cooling Degree Days (CDD) to enhance **emotional resonance**, **analytical clarity**, and **interactive exploration**. Inspired by foundational visualization theory (Munzner, 2014), affective design frameworks (Lan et al., 2023), and interactive climate visual principles (Mahyar, 2024), this redesign visualizes country-level temperature trends over time using open-source climate data and custom visual encodings.

## 📊 Features

- 🗺️ Dynamic choropleth map (country-level, 1900–2013)
- 🎨 Custom color scale (bone white → orange → purple) to evoke climate urgency
- 📆 Interactive timeline slider (play by year)
- 🖱️ Hover tooltips with temperature and country info
- 📌 Narrative tags for key events (e.g., 2003 European heatwave)

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

- [Python (Google Colab)](https://colab.research.google.com/)
- [Plotly](https://plotly.com/python/)
- [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)
- [Berkeley Earth dataset](http://berkeleyearth.org/data/)
